Funny Virus I made that "installs" Minecraft



Note that this is written in appleScript, so you can't run this on Windows. :(

Download the file Virus.zip, and extract and run it. You may get the unidentified developer thing. Trust me. I'm identified. I'm Metrost


If you want the raw, then download main.scpt, and run it from terminal using 
shell```
applescript main.scpt```

Have fun, and please star this respitory so I can make more of these!
